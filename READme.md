## **🛠 Tech Stack**
- **Python**: Data scraping, cleaning, and analysis
- **Libraries**:
  - `requests`, `BeautifulSoup4`: Web scraping
  - `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization
  - `Power BI`: Interactive dashboard creation

## **🔍 Data Collection**
The dataset was scraped from ..... using **BeautifulSoup** and **requests**. The scraped data includes details on:
- **Column 1**
- **Column 2**
- **Column 3**
- **Column 4**
- **Column 5**
- **Column 6**
- **Column 7**

The scraping script extracts this data and saves it in a **CSV file**.

## **🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
Using **pandas**, the dataset was cleaned to ensure consistency:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Rows missing `column name`, `column name`, and `column name` were removed.
2. **Data Type Conversion**:
   - Converted `column name` to numeric after removing `%`.
   - Extracted numeric values from `column name` (removed unnecessary details in brackets).
   - Standardized `column name`, `column name`, and `column name` by converting values ending with `B` (billion) and `M` (million) to full numbers.
3. Just list out some data cleaning process you did here
4. **Saved the cleaned dataset as a CSV file** for further analysis.
